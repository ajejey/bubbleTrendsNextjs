## 1. Understanding the Dropshipping Business Model: A Quick Recap

Dropshipping connects you with suppliers who handle inventory and shipping. When a customer buys from your store, you forward the order to the supplier, who ships the product directly. You act as the storefront, focusing on marketing and customer service.

## 2. Niche Selection & Product Research: Finding Your Goldmine

Choosing the right niche is paramount.  Don't just chase trends; find a balance between profitability, your interest, and market demand.

**Tools & Platforms:**

* **Google Trends ([https://trends.google.com/trends/](https://trends.google.com/trends/)):** Explore trending topics and identify emerging markets.
* **Exploding Topics ([https://explodingtopics.com/](https://explodingtopics.com/)):** Discover products and industries about to take off.
* **AliExpress Dropshipping Center (Built into AliExpress):**  Research product potential and estimate profit margins.

**Criteria for Niche Selection:**

**Product Validation:**

* **Run Test Ads:**  Before fully committing, run small test ad campaigns to gauge customer interest.

## 3. Finding & Vetting Suppliers: Building Trustworthy Partnerships

Your suppliers are the backbone of your business.  Reliability, product quality, and efficient shipping are non-negotiable.
